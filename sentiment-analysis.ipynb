      "402934  I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever/standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!   \n",

I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper.

At first, I wasn't too sure about the dressing, as it tasted nothing like regular Ranch dressings at all. By the third time I used it though, I decided it was great. Once you give up the real stuff, this does grow on you. I now love this dressing and will eat it for the rest of my life!</td>\n",

       "402934  Both formulas are excellent for my dogs! I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever/standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!   \n",

I discovered that I can drink this without creamer, which is nice because I am allergic to dairy and powdered creamers are just chemicals. Almond milk wasn't that great either. This is smooth, and the vanilla taste is like a gourmet coffee shop.   \n",

At first, I wasn't too sure about the dressing, as it tasted nothing like regular Ranch dressings at all. By the third time I used it though, I decided it was great. Once you give up the real stuff, this does grow on you. I now love this dressing and will eat it for the rest of my life!   \n",

The cats always lick off all of the \"broth\" it's packed in before moving on to the shreds of chicken breast itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than a diet consisting of only dry food, even if it's the best dry food.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have \"grazing priviledges\" with a bowl of high quality dry food (&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O\"&gt;Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food&lt;/a&gt;) that I typically have to fill once a day.

       "555887  I have two diabetic senior cats in my brood and I try to make sure I feel them all the best quality food I can fit into my budget.  The cats do love this food and I feel good feeding it to them because it is high quality.  The ingredients read like human-food, there are virtually no preservatives and it doesn't have that \"cat food\" smell.  The cats always lick off all of the \"broth\" it's packed in before moving on to the shreds of chicken breast itself.<br /><br />My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than a diet consisting of only dry food, even if it's the best dry food.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have \"grazing priviledges\" with a bowl of high quality dry food (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O\">Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food</a>) that I typically have to fill once a day.  I may buy this once in a while as a treat but they seem to enjoy the less expensive leading brand just as much.  "

Kind of like grape bubble gum. They are not as hard as I expected but I think they are worth the money.   \n",

       "555887  Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken wet cat food I have two diabetic senior cats in my brood and I try to make sure I feel them all the best quality food I can fit into my budget.  The cats do love this food and I feel good feeding it to them because it is high quality.  The ingredients read like human-food, there are virtually no preservatives and it doesn't have that \"cat food\" smell.  The cats always lick off all of the \"broth\" it's packed in before moving on to the shreds of chicken breast itself.<br /><br />My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than a diet consisting of only dry food, even if it's the best dry food.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have \"grazing priviledges\" with a bowl of high quality dry food (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O\">Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food</a>) that I typically have to fill once a day.  I may buy this once in a while as a treat but they seem to enjoy the less expensive leading brand just as much.   \n",
