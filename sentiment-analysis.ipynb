And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.

      "310812  I think the berry flavor is far better than the veggie powder as far as taste goes but I don't mind either one.  I add this to some juice, kefir, some coconut oil whatever, but I always add stevia with it.  I think this is a very cheap insurance to staying or getting healthy.  I battled with my health my whole life.  I try now to stay as natural as I can with my health care now.  It leads me to `well' a lot quicker. I was one of those DES babies you may or may not have heard about.  Our mothers took DES which was a drug to prevent a miscarriage but what happened was it caused problems with the baby and left a compromised immune system.  This is why my whole life it has been one thing after another.  Well, THIS powder is fantastic.  When I take this consistently I have far more energy and I just seem to stay well.  When I get lazy about it and stop taking it I have no energy, I get foggy brained, down in the dumps.  Big difference. I figure if I take this in the morning, the rest of the day is covered as far as my fruits and veggies are concerned.  What I do eat on top of this is a bonus!  If you `really' really can't stand the taste then add the stevia, add fruit, juice whatever, it so worth taking this powder!!  Personally I have no problem with the flavor. Five starts from me!   \n",

I would probably buy this again.   \n",

So this is a rather expensive cup of hot chocolate.  The flavor, at least to me, is terrible, it is mostly sugar and red dye.  It is a novel idea that might appeal to small kids but adults will find it sickeningly sweet. As mentioned above, it is rather expensive for what it is.  Only thing I like about this are the coffin shaped cans.   \n",

This was such a smooth flavor that I enjoyed drinking it all three ways, which has never happened before. I also love the pod design; I used my regular coffee machine, so the pods make clean up quick & easy.   \n",

I add this to some juice, kefir, some coconut oil whatever, but I always add stevia with it.  I think this is a very cheap insurance to staying or getting healthy.  I battled with my health my whole life.  I try now to stay as natural as I can with my health care now.  It leads me to `well' a lot quicker. I was one of those DES babies you may or may not have heard about.  Our mothers took DES which was a drug to prevent a miscarriage but what happened was it caused problems with the baby and left a compromised immune system.  This is why my whole life it has been one thing after another.  Well, THIS powder is fantastic.  When I take this consistently I have far more energy and I just seem to stay well.  When I get lazy about it and stop taking it I have no energy, I get foggy brained, down in the dumps.  Big difference. I figure if I take this in the morning, the rest of the day is covered as far as my fruits and veggies are concerned.  What I do eat on top of this is a bonus!  If you `really' really can't stand the taste then add the stevia, add fruit, juice whatever, it so worth taking this powder!!  Personally I have no problem with the flavor.

I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?</td>\n",

I think the berry flavor is far better than the veggie powder as far as taste goes but I don't mind either one.  I add this to some juice, kefir, some coconut oil whatever, but I always add stevia with it.  I think this is a very cheap insurance to staying or getting healthy.  I battled with my health my whole life.  I try now to stay as natural as I can with my health care now.  It leads me to `well' a lot quicker. I was one of those DES babies you may or may not have heard about.  Our mothers took DES which was a drug to prevent a miscarriage but what happened was it caused problems with the baby and left a compromised immune system.  This is why my whole life it has been one thing after another.  Well, THIS powder is fantastic.  When I take this consistently I have far more energy and I just seem to stay well.  When I get lazy about it and stop taking it I have no energy, I get foggy brained, down in the dumps.  Big difference. I figure if I take this in the morning, the rest of the day is covered as far as my fruits and veggies are concerned.  What I do eat on top of this is a bonus!  If you `really' really can't stand the taste then add the stevia, add fruit, juice whatever, it so worth taking this powder!!  Personally I have no problem with the flavor. Five starts from me!   \n",

       "308886  Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win. I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?   \n",

Oh My ~ Heavenly\" My sister-in-law brought me a jar of this smooth, creamy,  delicately sweet chocolate spread on her recent visit from the UK.<br /><br />Cadbury's spreads like butter, the other leading chocolate/hazelnut spread  can tend to be a little thick and tear the bread and I am not a fan of the hazelnut; I'd rather have the pure chocolate.<br /><br />Chocolate does not get much purer than Cadbury.<br /><br />One of my favorites is as a late night snack is made up of a wheat sandwich thin, one side with peanut butter the other side with Cadbury's.  Yum.<br /><br />For me it is worth the price; we have a British shop 30 miles in the next town over.  It was $10.70 there and I burned 2 gallons gas in the trip to pick it up.<br /><br />It is a luxurious treat.  Hide it from the kids :-)   \n",

As much as I would like to feed them what I give my dogs, it's just not in our budget. After much research and going to dogfoodadvisor.com we found this to be a good dog food without all the junk but for far less than other brands of comparable ingredients. We can actually get this 40lbs bag for about 26.00 at a pet food store about 40 minutes away. So, if we're in a pinch, I do order on line. A lot of fosters come in completely neglected and starved, the amount of food we go through can be mind boggling..lol, thanks diamond Naturals, not regular Diamond!   \n",

First of all, whoever eats regular quaker rolled oats, BELIEVE ME, once you try Steel Cut oats, you can never go back to that mushy gooey bowl of quick cooking oats. Initially when I switched over, I used to buy the McCann's 5 minute Steel Cut Oats which are pretty good, but once I discovered these, there was no going back! The size of each grain is larger in these, and when cooked and plumped up, it has a great texture (the McCann's one in comparison is smaller and tastes slightly gritty when cooked). To speed up the cooking time, I usually do this the night before:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour cold water over oats (+1tsp whole wheat flour/wheat or oat bran) the night before to abt 1\" above the level of oats in ur bowl... then microwave for 1.5 - 2 minutes (check that it doesnt overflow!)... then boil some water in a kettle and pour enough water to fill your bowl 1/2 way or 2/3 of the way to the top... then cover and let soak overnight... the next morning, add a little more water (if necessary) and microwave again for 2-3 minutes (again, check to make sure it doesnt overflow)... then add ur toppings and flavourings and Enjoy!!!! I do this every other morning and eat my oats at work, and it's well worth the little extra prep time the night before - trust me!!!</td>\n",

       "204480  Best Steel Cut Oats out there! First of all, whoever eats regular quaker rolled oats, BELIEVE ME, once you try Steel Cut oats, you can never go back to that mushy gooey bowl of quick cooking oats. Initially when I switched over, I used to buy the McCann's 5 minute Steel Cut Oats which are pretty good, but once I discovered these, there was no going back! The size of each grain is larger in these, and when cooked and plumped up, it has a great texture (the McCann's one in comparison is smaller and tastes slightly gritty when cooked). To speed up the cooking time, I usually do this the night before:<br /><br />Pour cold water over oats (+1tsp whole wheat flour/wheat or oat bran) the night before to abt 1\" above the level of oats in ur bowl... then microwave for 1.5 - 2 minutes (check that it doesnt overflow!)... then boil some water in a kettle and pour enough water to fill your bowl 1/2 way or 2/3 of the way to the top... then cover and let soak overnight... the next morning, add a little more water (if necessary) and microwave again for 2-3 minutes (again, check to make sure it doesnt overflow)... then add ur toppings and flavourings and Enjoy!!!! I do this every other morning and eat my oats at work, and it's well worth the little extra prep time the night before - trust me!!!   \n",

My favorite Salsa if a bit overpriced here. Gives things a kick, but is thick enough to also put on tortilla chips. Mrs Renfro isn't like some of the wussy companies putting out boring, tasteless salsas though its still pretty far from \"gourmet\".<br /><br />I recommend their Nacho cheese sauce as well (way better than the canned crap Campbells or anyone else puts out).<br /><br /> I have some really interesting bathroom stories from this stuff.. hehhehee..   \n",

Not impressed by that but overall very pleased with the coffee.   \n",

So this is a rather expensive cup of hot chocolate.  The flavor, at least to me, is terrible, it is mostly sugar and red dye.  It is a novel idea that might appeal to small kids but adults will find it sickeningly sweet. As mentioned above, it is rather expensive for what it is.  Only thing I like about this are the coffin shaped cans.   \n",

Tried it three different ways: black, just cream and cream & sugar. This was such a smooth flavor that I enjoyed drinking it all three ways, which has never happened before. I also love the pod design; I used my regular coffee machine, so the pods make clean up quick & easy.   \n",
