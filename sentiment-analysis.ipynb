We have them every time we make fajitas at home.  I've even added them to chili.  There's just something about the combination of ingredients that creates a very flavorful dish.  And these are whole beans in a tasty sauce, not the smashed paste that all other brands seem to offer.  Alas, these La Preferida beans are no longer available in my neighborhood - and I'm not gonna eat that bean paste everyone else sells.  I was very pleased to find these available on Amazon.  Bought two cases, received in two different shipments.  First shipment was fine.  The second shipment not so fine - every can was dented.  So far so good, though.   \n",
      "82751   \"Organic\" means that something in there was/might be organic.  This claims to be 100% organic.  USDA organic does not mean much any more.  I'm not sure what NDA is.<br /><br />Mine has an expiration date of 11/22/13.  It does not have a picked date. I wish it did.  Normal teas are best no more than a year from the picking date.  I have no idea how long it has been sitting around.<br /><br />It says it is pure leaves but there seems to be some white sticks in the mix.  And it is a mix.  Not many leaves - unlike the picture- more of a crunch.  I have to use my finest filter and some still goes through.  I don't use paper.<br /><br />A pound is a lot of tea.<br /><br />I mix it with my green tea in the am and it keeps me from getting jittery.

It tastes just right and knowing that it's organic makes it all the better.  I purchase it whenever I am on my last box and I find that it's available on Amazon because they run out of it quite frequently.  Grab it when you can!   \n",

We spent the rest of our trip searching for prickly pear syrup with no sucess.  Once we got to our winter destination I took what is usually my first option when looking for something: check on Amazon.  I ordered one bottle of Cahill to see if it was worth the price and, upon receipt and a homemade prickly pear margarita, I attempted to purchase several more bottles.  Unfortunately no further were available from Amazon, so I had to search the net for another source which we located and purchased.   \n",

Alas, these La Preferida beans are no longer available in my neighborhood - and I'm not gonna eat that bean paste everyone else sells.  I was very pleased to find these available on Amazon.

We have them every time we make fajitas at home.  I've even added them to chili.  There's just something about the combination of ingredients that creates a very flavorful dish.  And these are whole beans in a tasty sauce, not the smashed paste that all other brands seem to offer.  Alas, these La Preferida beans are no longer available in my neighborhood - and I'm not gonna eat that bean paste everyone else sells.  I was very pleased to find these available on Amazon.  Bought two cases, received in two different shipments.  First shipment was fine.  The second shipment not so fine - every can was dented.  So far so good, though.   \n",

We've grown to absolutely love La Preferida Mexican Homestyle Beans.  We have them every time we make fajitas at home.  I've even added them to chili.  There's just something about the combination of ingredients that creates a very flavorful dish.  And these are whole beans in a tasty sauce, not the smashed paste that all other brands seem to offer.  Alas, these La Preferida beans are no longer available in my neighborhood - and I'm not gonna eat that bean paste everyone else sells.  I was very pleased to find these available on Amazon.  Bought two cases, received in two different shipments.  First shipment was fine.  The second shipment not so fine - every can was dented.  So far so good, though.   \n",
       "82751   Price was good, needs a date and where it's from \"Organic\" means that something in there was/might be organic.  This claims to be 100% organic.  USDA organic does not mean much any more.  I'm not sure what NDA is.<br /><br />Mine has an expiration date of 11/22/13.  It does not have a picked date. I wish it did.  Normal teas are best no more than a year from the picking date.  I have no idea how long it has been sitting around.<br /><br />It says it is pure leaves but there seems to be some white sticks in the mix.  And it is a mix.  Not many leaves - unlike the picture- more of a crunch.  I have to use my finest filter and some still goes through.  I don't use paper.<br /><br />A pound is a lot of tea.<br /><br />I mix it with my green tea in the am and it keeps me from getting jittery.  Tastes like Tulsi to me but... the real, fresh leaf is very fine indeed.<br /><br />And where is it from?  US, India? Belize?   \n",

This does not live up to the quality of Planters products. I thought this bar would be nutty and fruity like the Nut-rition mixes. However, I was disappointed... very few almonds, peanuts, and cranberries per bar. Texture is like sawdust. Not much flavor... I think I will be sticking with Nature's Valley Chewy Trail Mix bars. Saving grace... may be good for someone who likes chewy bars that taste like they have very little sugar, but actually has 9g of sugar which is a lot since one bar is 35g. Each bar is 160 calories compared to same size Nature's Valley Chewy Trail Mix bar that's 140 calories (but has 13g of sugar).   \n",

Tasted horrible, fell apart.  The pancakes and waffles have been a hit.  Cookie recipie was not all that wonderful either.  I like it for when I am in a pinch or if hubby has to cook but otherwise sticking to my own mixes.   \n",

This a fabulous deal for the money.  A little goes a VERY long way, I think this will last us a long time.  For a large casserole or soup I use about 1 Tablespoon (we have 2 young kids).  It permeates the dish with that wonderful smokiness and a nice dash of heat.  Yummy!   \n",

CRUNCHY, BUTTERY GOODNESS! The thing I really like most about them though is that they're not nearly as sickening-sweet.  You can munch on them pretty much all day and not get sick of that over bearing sweetness that makes your mouth feel chalky and dry.  They've almost got a nutty flavor to them. I can't really describe it.  If you like Butterfinger, minus the chocolate, try a Chick o Stick.  I think you'll like them.   \n",

       "491594  The perfect margarita While traveling to the Texas coast last winter we spent a few days in Fredricksburg where my wife fell in love with prickly pear margaritas at our favorite restaurant.  We spent the rest of our trip searching for prickly pear syrup with no sucess.  Once we got to our winter destination I took what is usually my first option when looking for something: check on Amazon.  I ordered one bottle of Cahill to see if it was worth the price and, upon receipt and a homemade prickly pear margarita, I attempted to purchase several more bottles.  Unfortunately no further were available from Amazon, so I had to search the net for another source which we located and purchased.   \n",
