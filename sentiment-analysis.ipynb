      "162433  I purchased this cereal because it appeared to be very healthy and promising. But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell.   \n",

Gluten free. Good. It doesn't take as long to cook as the directions say. Just watch it until you think it is done. It can be eaten with a variety of things added - raisins, brown sugar, & cinnamon; maple syrup, etc. The price is not good (Unusual for Amazon). Walmart carries it for about $1.50+ less per box ($9.00+ less per 6). Ouch! When they get a better price and put it on Subscribe & Save I'll buy it here again.   \n",

The peanuts provide protein while the rice and chocolate provide carbs.  These bars would be great for anyone with a busy lifestyle.  They're not messy, which makes them an ideal snack while working on the computer.  They're surprisingly tasty and flavorful.  The consistency is very appealing - soft yet crispy.  I buy these a lot.   \n",

Several of the K-cups were ciders and there was a hot chocolate.  That would be fine if the seller disclosed that in the description but to say you're sending 24 COFFEE samples, then send something other than coffee is just plain deceitful.   \n",

Gluten free. Good. It doesn't take as long to cook as the directions say. Just watch it until you think it is done. It can be eaten with a variety of things added - raisins, brown sugar, & cinnamon; maple syrup, etc. The price is not good (Unusual for Amazon). Walmart carries it for about $1.50+ less per box ($9.00+ less per 6). Ouch! When they get a better price and put it on Subscribe & Save I'll buy it here again.   \n",

But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell.</td>\n",

       "162433  Rancid Smell and Taste I purchased this cereal because it appeared to be very healthy and promising. But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell.   \n",

Gluten free. Good. It doesn't take as long to cook as the directions say. Just watch it until you think it is done. It can be eaten with a variety of things added - raisins, brown sugar, & cinnamon; maple syrup, etc. The price is not good (Unusual for Amazon). Walmart carries it for about $1.50+ less per box ($9.00+ less per 6). Ouch! When they get a better price and put it on Subscribe & Save I'll buy it here again.   \n",

They brought a smile to her face and she loved them before so she loved them then. I didn't like the way they were packaged to her, they were just in a box, so I feared that they would get crushed in shipment but she said they were fine and that didn't matter.

So many other reviewers have pointed out the list of dubious ingredients that it doesn't pay to duplicate them again, but I urge you to take a long, hard look at that list before you commit to purchasing this item.<br /><br />Nutrition aside, this is a very tasty food item based on my dogs' response to finding it in their bowl. Frankly, they went bonkers over Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I'm probably not going to make this part of their regular diet, but I will continue using it as a treat.   \n",

       "      <td>Feeding Costs and Guidelines Orijen seems to be what experts want us to feed to our dogs.  It smells nasty so we keep it sealed and the dog loves it more than Newman's Own (N.O.) Organic dry (no bad smell, dog doesn't like it).  We've always mixed N.O. with some (decidedly stinky) wet food.  Anyway, I've read that some dogs have intestinal upset with the Orijen food due to high protein content.  Others quote the high price of the food.  I agreed, but changed my mind when I read the feeding guidelines.  Here is a big tip from the Orijen people. \"We recommend that you feed twice daily. Simply divide the amount suggested on the feeding guide into two meals, spaced eight to twelve hours apart. You may need to adjust portions as you learn your dog's ideal daily \"maintenance\" amount, always keeping in mind that a lean dog is a healthy dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRANSITIONING FOODS&lt;br /&gt;\"Dogs are often fed the same food, which means a sudden food change makes it difficult for their digestive systems to adapt. That's why it's important to introduce the new food gradually. Going slowly will give your dog or cat time to adjust to their new food and will also reduce the chances of digestive upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\"Start by mixing 25% new food with 75% old food. Slowly change the proportions over the next three to five days by gradually increasing the amount of ORIJEN and decreasing the amount of old food. At the end of this transitioning process, you should be feeding 100% ORIJEN.\" ~Quoted from the website of the Orijen dog food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST PER SERVING&lt;br /&gt;We plan to continue the small amount of Orijen and see how our 30 pound Border mix rescue handles eating about 1/2 cup of food twice a day instead of the 1 and-a-half cups of N.O. that sits all day until she decides to eat it.  So far, the transition period is going very well.  She does a pretty nice job picking out the Orijen kibble and leaving the N.O..  So, for 1c. per day, if a 1/2 c. measure of kibble weighs approximately 1 oz on my non-scientific kitchen scale, then 30 pounds of food for 63 dollars is about 16 servings per pound or 480 servings per bag - which is 63/480... about 13 cents per serving @ 2 per day = 26 cents per day?  N.O. is (subscribe&amp;save .11 cents per ounce, but my dog needs (but won't eat unless mixed with wet) needs 3 times the amount (1 and-a-half cups per serving which is 6 oz. on my kitchen scale \"20-40 pound dog 1-1/3 to 2-1/4 cup) per serving or per day, I don't know, but we feed her 1.5 cups twice a day (6 oz. x .11 cents per oz.= 66 cents x 2 = $1.32 N.O. per day) is still more costly than Orijen at .26 cents per day. So for us, at least, the transition is cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that a half cup of food per serving is so little food, I'll probably supplement her meals with something else. Should I let go of the N.O. kibble just yet?</td>\n",

I find that if I brew it with less than boiling water -around 190-200 degrees (just boil and wait a minute after pouring the water in the cup before adding the bag) and steep for 3 minutes, it comes out perfect. If I do want to sweeten it, I use orange blossom honey and it is great! Best of all, I didn't break the bank to get tea that I could enjoy.

If they ever switch to made in the U.S. I'll buy it again as I did like it.   \n",
       "182648  Feeding Costs and Guidelines Orijen seems to be what experts want us to feed to our dogs.  It smells nasty so we keep it sealed and the dog loves it more than Newman's Own (N.O.) Organic dry (no bad smell, dog doesn't like it).  We've always mixed N.O. with some (decidedly stinky) wet food.  Anyway, I've read that some dogs have intestinal upset with the Orijen food due to high protein content.  Others quote the high price of the food.  I agreed, but changed my mind when I read the feeding guidelines.  Here is a big tip from the Orijen people. \"We recommend that you feed twice daily. Simply divide the amount suggested on the feeding guide into two meals, spaced eight to twelve hours apart. You may need to adjust portions as you learn your dog's ideal daily \"maintenance\" amount, always keeping in mind that a lean dog is a healthy dog!<br /><br />TRANSITIONING FOODS<br />\"Dogs are often fed the same food, which means a sudden food change makes it difficult for their digestive systems to adapt. That's why it's important to introduce the new food gradually. Going slowly will give your dog or cat time to adjust to their new food and will also reduce the chances of digestive upset.<br /><br />\"Start by mixing 25% new food with 75% old food. Slowly change the proportions over the next three to five days by gradually increasing the amount of ORIJEN and decreasing the amount of old food. At the end of this transitioning process, you should be feeding 100% ORIJEN.\" ~Quoted from the website of the Orijen dog food.<br /><br />COST PER SERVING<br />We plan to continue the small amount of Orijen and see how our 30 pound Border mix rescue handles eating about 1/2 cup of food twice a day instead of the 1 and-a-half cups of N.O. that sits all day until she decides to eat it.  So far, the transition period is going very well.  She does a pretty nice job picking out the Orijen kibble and leaving the N.O..  So, for 1c. per day, if a 1/2 c. measure of kibble weighs approximately 1 oz on my non-scientific kitchen scale, then 30 pounds of food for 63 dollars is about 16 servings per pound or 480 servings per bag - which is 63/480... about 13 cents per serving @ 2 per day = 26 cents per day?  N.O. is (subscribe&save .11 cents per ounce, but my dog needs (but won't eat unless mixed with wet) needs 3 times the amount (1 and-a-half cups per serving which is 6 oz. on my kitchen scale \"20-40 pound dog 1-1/3 to 2-1/4 cup) per serving or per day, I don't know, but we feed her 1.5 cups twice a day (6 oz. x .11 cents per oz.= 66 cents x 2 = $1.32 N.O. per day) is still more costly than Orijen at .26 cents per day. So for us, at least, the transition is cost-effective.<br /><br />Given that a half cup of food per serving is so little food, I'll probably supplement her meals with something else. Should I let go of the N.O. kibble just yet?   \n",

I initially bought these for the sore throats that start when you have to turn on the heat for the winter months.  Well, they are quite addictive!!  I now eat them like candy.  Great honey-flavor with a liquid honey center.  If you order them using Auto Delivery, you will get a discount and free shipping.  Get ready for a new favorite!   \n",

If you like tea as I do, you will really like this tea. This is not flavored or blended. Sure, I know it is \"bag\" tea and not \"loose\", and I know all about all the other things like the flush (harvest), the cut and such, but you don't have to be a tea \"snob\" to like this tea. I find that if I brew it with less than boiling water -around 190-200 degrees (just boil and wait a minute after pouring the water in the cup before adding the bag) and steep for 3 minutes, it comes out perfect. If I do want to sweeten it, I use orange blossom honey and it is great! Best of all, I didn't break the bank to get tea that I could enjoy. You can spend more, a lot more, and get \"better\", but I am perfectly happy with this because it is good tea, and at the rate I drink it, it is saving me a bunch of money. To me, that makes it taste even better!   \n",

This stuff is delicious!  I can't walk past the jar without getting a spoonful.  It has a peanut butter consistency but it tastes like coconut!  Actually it's so sweet it tastes like coconut candy!   \n",

I had to mix them with hot sauce to give them some flavor. Even better with jalapenos. Did like the fact there were no bones.   \n",

The peanuts provide protein while the rice and chocolate provide carbs.  These bars would be great for anyone with a busy lifestyle.  They're not messy, which makes them an ideal snack while working on the computer.  They're surprisingly tasty and flavorful.  The consistency is very appealing - soft yet crispy.  I buy these a lot.   \n",

Several of the K-cups were ciders and there was a hot chocolate.  That would be fine if the seller disclosed that in the description but to say you're sending 24 COFFEE samples, then send something other than coffee is just plain deceitful.   \n",
